# my_configs
Configurations for my system. An i3 session with Pointerkeys, a conky status bar and more.
The reason why the i3 configuration is in /etc/i3 is because other users who use my systems are happy with the same configuration.

These configurations are an archive of my own setup, I highly recommend you modify the configurations accordingly before applying them to your own system, you may consider putting the i3 configuration into ~/.config/i3/config or ~/.i3/config instead.
