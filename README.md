# my_configs
Configurations for my system. An i3 session with Pointerkeys, a conky status bar and more.
The reason why the i3 configuration is in /etc/i3 is because other users in the home are happy with the same configuration.

## Dependancies
* i3
* xinit
* feh
* xautolock
* xtrlock
* st
* xkbset
* conky
* dmenu
